**Test Case Name:** | subclass
**Current Status:** | :bangbang: open

## Versions and Flavors

### MDCS : master branch, 8 Dec 2016

*  Although the abstract base class is not included, given the current
   behavior of [subclass](../subclass), it's likely that this test
   case's behavior is correct for the wrong reasons.  That is, it is
   not clear whether the application recognizes the `abstract`
   attribute. 

*  Subclass of subclass not included.
