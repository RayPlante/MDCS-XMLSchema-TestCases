  * import statement:
    o  schema uploader claims that schemaLocation is required but
       strictly this is not true.  It's not clear what the proper
       value should be in the context of the curator.
    o  when including a schemaLocation element, it fails to validate
       the schema, due to:

         Not a valid XML schema.
         complex type ElectronMicroscope, attribute base: The QName
         value {urn:experiments}Equipment does not resolve to a(n)
         simple type definition., line 14

    o  When you alerted about an import statement, the GUI says:

         Please check that the resource is accessible (not on your
         local file system, or on a server down).

       I don't understand what this means; some better wording is
       probably in order.

    o  import works when schemaLocation is a file: URL on the server.
    o  if a global element does not exist, it uses xsi:type to for an
       OTF root element based on a global type.
    o  Regardless of the existence of a global element, it does not
       render type model correctly.
